# Hey, I'm Michael 👋

**iOS Engineer** building products from 0→1 with Swift, SwiftUI, and a passion for clean architecture.

I'm a founding engineer at [Faithflow](https://github.com/miikeyanderson/Faithflow), where I built and shipped a production iOS app end-to-end — from architecture design through App Store launch. I love turning ideas into polished mobile experiences.

## 💡 My Approach

I care about **product thinking** — not just writing code, but understanding *why* we're building it. I believe great iOS apps come from:

- **Clean architecture** that scales with the team
- **User empathy** that drives every feature decision
- **Ownership** from idea through App Store submission
